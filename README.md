# RobustResNet50
Testing out microsoft/resnet-50, Hugging Face model with pictures after adding in Gaussian Noise.
The link to the blog to understand reasons and outcomes for testing out the model : https://medium.com/@hv6700030/the-great-pixel-revolt-watching-ai-navigate-a-world-gone-fuzzy-1f0070ba0a94 

You can add any images you wish to the model simply put in the path in the path asked for main_image and you can see your results.
The project is made, in order to demonstrate the prediction results of the model before and after adding in the gaussian noise.
